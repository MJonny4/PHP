# myPHPage
 - Template for www.ximuntion.com 
 - This is the first version (1.0) of my webpage, future updates wont be published anymore
 - This can be used as a template for any of you
 - I used MySQL, it needs a: 
	- 📝 database    = db
	- 📝 table	 = users (username, email, password)
	- 📝 table	 = contacts (name, email, message)
 - Also I used w3.css and a bit of bootstap 5.
 - GOOD LUCK ;D
